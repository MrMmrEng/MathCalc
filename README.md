Hello..!!

This is a match calculator for basic Arithematic.

This is a simple, clean, and well-structured example of a basic math application using Streamlit that accepts two numbers from the user and adds them. 
This example follows good coding and deployment practices, so you can easily extend it for more complex apps.
You may follow similar steps to code, deploy complex application. 

1. Application Code (MathCalc.py)
2. Requirements File (requirements.txt)
3. Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

**Explanation & Best Practices**

1.Single entry point (main() function): Keeps code organized and makes it easier to expand.
2.Input validation: Using st.number_input ensures only valid numbers are accepted.
3.Button-driven action: Calculation only runs when user clicks "Add".
4.Clear user messages: Using st.success() to show results clearly.
5.Minimal dependencies: Only streamlit is required, listed in requirements.txt.
6.File naming: MathCalc.py is descriptive and follows Python naming conventions.
7.Modular & scalable: You can add more functions or pages later and keep this structure.

Happy Learning !!!
